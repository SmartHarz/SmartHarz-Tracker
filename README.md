# SmartHarz-Tracker (English|[Deutsch weiter unten](#smartharz-tracker-deutsch))

A LoRaWAN tracker based on the [Lilygo T-Echo](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Echo).

The T-Echo is based on following components:

- Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 MCU
- SemTech SX1262 LoRa Tranceiver
- Quectel GNSS L76 module
- an 200*200px e-paper display
- a user button
- a touch button
- (optional) Bosch Sensortec BME280

As Meshtastic and SoftRF are available for the T-Echo already, a tracker was the next logical step. Especially as we are currently have a number of Dragino LGT-92 trackers deployed at the fire departments of Goslar. As the LGT-92 is sadly EOL we are looking for a good replacement and the T-Echo is looking promising and offers even more features.
